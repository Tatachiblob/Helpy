The platform charges services fees for transactions between clients and partners as it serves as the main source of revenue. In the event money is returned to the clients due to failure of service, cancellations, defective units, or any unforeseen event that results in the returning of the balance to the original owner the platform shall still charge a service fee for using the system and its features.

                                Clients who wishes to avail services from HelpyNow are paired with a supplier which is referred to as "Helpy Partners". Tasks that are requested must only range walking distance of the partners or .03km. Requests that ask partners to go beyond can be considered out of bounds. Compensations for these services must start at a base rate of 50 pesos that can scale up depending on request. Helpy partners can choose not to accept these jobs when the compensations are too low or job request seems impossible. Environmental or surroundings can change the prices such as rain, floods, and foot traffic and time of day. Once compensation amounts have been confirmed there cannot be any change of prices by any party until the job is finished. If there are unprecedented events that require the job to canceled or discontinued, then only a 40% of the money will be transferred to the partner for their effort and time served. When a job is finished money is only released when both the client and partner confirms through their own accounts the job is finished.

                                Rented items are available for service starting at 9 am to 7pm. An item will only be considered reserved when there is a payment deposited to the system for the item.

However, there will be a grace period of 15 mins from the exact time on the system.  Request for items to be put aside or reserved before payments will not be entertained by the administration.

                                By availing of the item it is under duly diligence of the client to take care of the item. If anything becomes broken or lost during the time it is borrowed, the item's displayed value must be played by the client to the system.
